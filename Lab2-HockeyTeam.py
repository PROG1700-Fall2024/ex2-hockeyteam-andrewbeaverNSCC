# LAB 2 - HOCKEY TEAM
#Write a program that will ask the user to enter the name of a hockey team, how many wins the team has and 
# how many losses #the team has.

#The program should calculate and display a single string output containing the team name, it's win-loss 
# ratio and the win #percentage formatted to 4 decimal places.

#Ex: The Calgary Flames have 10 wins and 5 losses, with a win percentage of 0.6667.

#Purpose/Concepts: Input and output to screen, string concatentation, string formatting, datatype casting, 
# simple math operations
